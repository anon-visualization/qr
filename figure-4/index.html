        <p><strong>Figure 4.</strong> Annotated screenshot from an animation produced using the IGS. The screenshot shows the movement and conversation of the entire Bluegrass Family. Conversation is shown as rectangles aligned along the x-axis of the floor plan and also along the z-axis in the space-time view. Annotations, readable conversation, and video mark a moment mid-way through the Bluegrass Familyâ€™s visit to this space and illustrate different features of the IGS to animate and interact with data. Full animation available <a href="https://youtu.be/zcrSmRZpzwQ">here</p>
